Artificial Intelligence Final Project (Fall 2017)

#Abstract
N-queen problem is one of the typical algorithm problems. By using depth first algorithm to solve it, it takes 15 minutes to find a solution for 40-queens, which is the limitation to this method, while using backtracking search can speed it up to 74 secs and even breaks the limitation to 50-queens, though it takes more memory space to store other candidate nodes during processing.
